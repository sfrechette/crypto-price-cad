# crypto-price-cad
This code is for the M5StickC Plus to display the current rates of Bitcoin (BTC),  Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) in Canadian dollars (CAD) using the CoinMarketCap API. The rates are updated every 5 minutes. Each rate is displayed for 10 seconds before switching to the next rate.

You will need to create an account and register for an API Key on CoinMarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com/api/. You can create a free subscription - basic personal use (10K call credits /mo).
